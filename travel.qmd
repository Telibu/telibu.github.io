# [🇰🇷] My Travel Experience in Seoul

Visiting **Seoul**, the vibrant capital of South Korea, was a dream come true. From the bustling streets of **Myeongdong** to the serene beauty of **Namsan Park**, every corner of this city has a story to tell.

## My First Winter

### A Season of Stillness and Surprise

I had never experienced real winter before visiting Seoul. The first morning I saw snow outside my window, everything felt surreal — **rooftops dusted in white**, **quiet streets**, and the soft crunch of fresh snow under my boots. It was like walking through a postcard.

I visited **Namsan Tower** as snowflakes drifted around me, and the city lights shimmered through the cold haze. The **air was crisp**, and my breath came out in clouds — it felt both **peaceful and powerful**. 

At **Gyeongbokgung Palace**, the contrast of ancient architecture against the white snow made me feel like I'd stepped into a different era. Locals and tourists alike were taking photos, sipping hot drinks, and simply **soaking in the beauty of winter**.

That first winter taught me to **slow down**, appreciate quiet moments, and find joy in small things — like warm hands, spicy *tteokbokki*, or a snowflake landing on my coat.

### Growth Through Independence

This trip taught me to be more **independent** and **adaptable** — from navigating a different language to using public transport to find hidden cafes and neighborhoods.

### Kindness Across Cultures

Koreans were welcoming, and even with a language barrier, people helped me with directions and food recommendations. I was reminded that kindness doesn’t need translation.

##  Final Thoughts

Seoul gave me more than memories — it gave me perspective. The energy, beauty, and depth of the city still inspire me today in how I approach life and challenges.

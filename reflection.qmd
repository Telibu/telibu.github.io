Throughout this assessment, I used ChatGPT by OpenAI as my primary Generative AI tool. I chose it because of its conversational style and ability to provide quick, detailed responses on a wide range of topics, including coding, markdown formatting, and writing assistance.

## How ChatGPT helped me complete the assessment

ChatGPT assisted me in several key ways:

- **Formatting guidance:** It showed me how to properly structure Markdown tables, add images, and create multi-page Quarto websites.
- **Troubleshooting:** When I encountered errors, such as image display issues or Quarto build errors, ChatGPT helped me understand and fix the problems.
- **Ease of use:** I could ask questions in natural language, and it provided clear instructions that were easy to follow.

## Benefits of using ChatGPT

- Instant help with coding and markdown syntax.
- Ability to generate well structured, ready to use templates quickly.

## Challenges of using ChatGPT

- The template i requested at times were not exactly what I needed, requiring me to modify them.
- Slightly feeling overreliant on the tool, which made me question my own coding skills.

## Future use of GenAI tools

I see ChatGPT and similar tools as powerful assistants that will help me with:

- Writing and editing documents more efficiently.
- Generating ideas and outlines for HTML.
- Saving time on routine tasks while focusing on creativity and critical thinking.

## Final thoughts

This experience has shown me how Generative AI can be a valuable partner in learning and creating, especially when combined with my own judgment and effort. I am excited to keep exploring its potential in my studies and future career.
